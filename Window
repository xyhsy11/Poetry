Window           
Author: Siyu Han        


Inside window, it is a bondage,
Outside window it is wander about unhurriedly.


Inside window, it is keeping watch,
Outside window, it is dreams.


Inside window, it is vague, 
Outside window, it is hope.


Inside window, it is a peacefulness, happy and auspicious
land, 
Outside window, it is chaotic, torrential ocean.
