The   Hour 

Author : Siyu Han 

When the hour hand goes forward, is infinite hope,
The hour hand goes backward, was time passing.

When the hour hand goes forward, is stars and dreams interweave,
The hour hand goes backward, was light and fire keeping watch.

When the hour hand goes forward, is a time of firmness, hope, everlasting days,
The hour hand goes backward, was a time of lost, missing, praise the epic.

When the hour hand goes forward, is boundless space,
The hour hand goes backward, was mysterious universeï¼Œ

When the hour hand goes forward, is green years,
The hour hand goes backward, was anxiety time.
